# Introduction
Since inappropriate planning of the cities, there has been a big problem of traffic in most cities of Lebanon. People spend much of their time in traffic every day. In Addition to this many vehicles in traffic makes rapid oil consumption, there has been an uprising problem of air pollution. Oil supplies are very limited all over the world and oil prices are extremely expensive in our country. Therefore, most of the people have to take buses and since the number of public transportation vehicles are not suficient, they travel under uncomfortable conditions.

There are some attempts to solve these problems, however, they focus only on intercity transportation. We came up with an effective solution.Our project will be used for both intercity and urban transportations all over India. As a result, our system will be designed to solve these problems and deficiencies of other systems .

# Scope
The ‚ÄúCar Pooling for IITI‚Äù is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the closest vehicle based on the user‚Äôs current position and other specifications like time of departure, price, contact information of passengers travelling and number of seats available. This information will act as the basis for the search results displayed to the user. The application should be free to download when published  from either a mobile phone application store or similar services. Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on firebase( an online db service). By using the GPS-Navigator.The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the available vehicles which will take the passenger to the required destination .

This application will bring about a big revolution in sharing vehicles thus reducing pollution and traffic in cities. This will be operated from both the passenger intended to travel and the passenger already travelling in a vehicle and willing to share their ride.

# Functions
#Sign Up: Users need to sign up to use the app. The users should have a username and password. After filling their name, surname, email, age, designation, phone and gender information, they register into the system.Also Signup can be done using google threw your google account

#Sign In: If a user is signed up, s/he can sign in the system by filling username and password boxes.


#Accepting passengers preferences: This functionality allows passengers to enter their departure point.

#Personalised suggestions: Our CarPooling Application analyses the database frequently and gives personalised suggestions regarding best departing time(based on time tolerances)(this is dif erent from preferred time as it may happen that a big cluster may begin their journey at some time just before or after the preferred time, so our app may request us to depart at the nearest time possible to the preferred time) , travelling time, mode of transport(car,autos,cabs,busses) and nearest pickup locations and all other locations of pickup(there will be a certain criterion (distance)for suggesting a place as the best point for boarding the vehicle which is certainly walkable from the current position of the user)(this is dif erent from our point of departure as sometimes, it may happen that a big cluster may depart from a point near the preferred pickup point , so our app may suggest them to depart from the changed point) (this functionality also encompasses route to that point)so that number of clusters is minimised at any point of time, which is beneficial to all the users, as per head cost is significantly reduced.

#Adding clusters to the database: Our application also needs user‚Äôs amicable co-ordination. If users are ready to accompany some people then, this may also become a potential cluster and adding this to the database will improve the reachability of the app. So, we enable users of the app with the best possible UI to add their current location, their departure time, departure point, arrival point. This is also integrated with personal chat with the passengers of the cluster for knowing the conditions of the traf ic and also the feasibility of their inclusion in their cluster i.e, if there exists heavy traf ic in the route planned before then, by personal chat existing passengers may request him/her to choose another cluster over them or begin a new cluster.

#Send Message: The users can communicate with each other by sending messages using whatsapp Chat Application.


#See cluster‚Äôs route: This functionality enables the user to see a particular cluster‚Äôs current route and this is preceded by a set of all available clusters ready to accommodate additional passengers.



App Requirements

The device should be a ‚ÄúSmartPhone‚Äù , not a Feature Phone.
Location Service: The device must have a GPS(Global positioning system) receiver hardware installed in it.

# Additions About Car-Share App üöò
Car-Share is android based application for car sharing .

The two main functions that app includes are -
The app uses  Google Maps API

Geocoding API (provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses)
Places API (returns information about places using HTTP requests)


Your android app is connected to Firebase project "senior1".
That's all!
Keep Going!!!
