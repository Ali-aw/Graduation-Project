# üöò Graduation-Project üöò
Here is a small demonstration for the app uploaded to youtube:



# Introduction
Since inappropriate planning of the cities, there has been a big problem of traffic in most cities of Lebanon. People spend much of their time in traffic every day. In Addition to this many vehicles in traffic makes rapid oil consumption, there has been an uprising problem of air pollution. Oil supplies are very limited all over the world and oil prices are extremely expensive in our country. Therefore, most of the people have to take buses and since the number of public transportation vehicles are not suficient, they travel under uncomfortable conditions.

There are some attempts to solve these problems, however, they focus only on intercity transportation. We came up with an effective solution.Our project will be used for both intercity and urban transportations all over Lebanon. As a result, our system will be designed to solve these problems and deficiencies of other systems .

# Scope
The ‚ÄúCar Pooling for IITI‚Äù is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the closest vehicle based on the user‚Äôs current position and other specifications like time of departure, price, contact information of passengers travelling and number of seats available. This information will act as the basis for the search results displayed to the user. The application should be free to download when published  from either a mobile phone application store or similar services. Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on firebase( an online db service). By using the GPS-Navigator.The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the available vehicles which will take the passenger to the required destination .

This application will bring about a big revolution in sharing vehicles thus reducing pollution and traffic in cities. This will be operated from both the passenger intended to travel and the passenger already travelling in a vehicle and willing to share their ride.
